This app was created out of my desperation to improve my terrible memorization skills. The two most popular spaced-repetition learning platforms, Anki and Quizlet, didn’t work intuitively for my learning style. So, I built this app.

Current progress: I’m working on making the card-creation process even smoother by adding AI.
