This app was created because there are too many class materials that I need to remember. The two most popular spaced-repetition learning platforms, Anki and Quizlet, didn’t work intuitively for me. So, I built this app.

Current progress: I’m working on making the card-creation process even smoother by adding AI.

## Tech Stack

This app uses MERN stack:

- React (frontend library)
- Passport.js LocalStrategy (authentication)
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Express.js (backend framework)
- Node.js (runtime environment).

## How to Run This App Locally

```bash
git clone <url>
npm install
cd backend && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
